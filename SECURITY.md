# Security

We at Inditex believe that responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the security and privacy
of all opensource community.

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Inditex repository that meets Inditex definition of a
security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below. We appreciate the hard work maintainers put into
fixing vulnerabilities and understand that sometimes more time is required to properly address an issue.

## Reporting security issues

> [!CAUTION]
> Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities

* Let us know by submitting the finding through our [dedicated email address](mailto:vuln.disclosure@inditex.com)
as soon as possible, upon discovery of a potential security issue.
* Once we've assessed your report, we will create a GitHub "security advisory", which will allow the reporter and
Inditex team to work on the issue in a confidential manner. We will invite you as a collaborator to the advisory and any
needed trusted persons.
* That "security advisory" will also allow us to have a temporary private fork, to work on the fix in confidentiality.
* Once a fix is ready, we will include the fix in our next release and mark that release as a security release.
* Details on the issue will be embargoed for 30 days to give users an oppurtunity to upgrade, after which we will
coordinate disclosure with the researcher(s).
* If you've contributed the fix, you will be credited for it.
