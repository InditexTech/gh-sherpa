# Sherpa extension for GitHub CLI

Sherpa for [GitHub CLI](https://github.com/cli/cli) makes it easy for you to **create branches** and **pull requests**
associated with any **GitHub or Jira issue**.

This extension retrieves the type of issue (_User Story_, _Bug_, _Technical Improvement_, etc) and creates a branch or 
pull request associated with that issue, following the contribution model you define in a 
[configuration file](#configuration).

## Configuration

Sherpa uses different issue types (`feature`, `bugfix`, `hotfix`, `refactoring`, etc) when mapping an issue with its
corresponding branch prefix.

### Default configuration

By default, it will use the [`internal/config/default-config.yml`](internal/config/default-config.yml) configuration
file to perform these mappings.

### Custom configuration

Otherwise, if you wish customize the different issue types, branch prefixes, etc, so, you can **create your own configuration
file** localed in `$HOME/.config/sherpa/config.yml` from the [default config file](internal/config/default-config.yml).

> If you are **using Jira as issue tracker**, so, the first time you run a command it will ask you to configure Jira credentials and then proceed to create the custom configuration file with the provided Jira credentials.
