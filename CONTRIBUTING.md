## Contribution Guidelines

- All contributors are expected to follow the project's [code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Please be respectful and considerate towards other contributors.
- Before starting work on a new feature or fix, check existing [issues](../../issues) and [pull requests](../../pulls) to avoid duplications and unnecessary discussions.
- If you wish to work on an existing issue, comment on the issue to inform other contributors that you are working on it. This will help coordinate efforts and prevent conflicts.
- It is always advisable to discuss and gather feedback from the community before making significant changes to the project's structure or architecture.
- Ensure a clean and organized commit history. Divide your changes into logical and descriptive commits.
- Document any new changes or features you add. This will help other contributors and project users understand your work and its purpose.
- Be sure to link the corresponding issue in your pull request to maintain proper tracking of contributions.

## Development

Make sure that you have:

- Read the rest of the [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) sections.
- Meet the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).
- [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/install) (version `1.20.4` or higher).
- [GNU Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) (version `4.2.1` or higher).
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) (version `2.25.1` or higher).

Activate the development mode setting `GH_SHERPA_DEV` environment variable:

```sh
export GH_SHERPA_DEV=1
```

Install the extension using the local path:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/InditexTech/gh-sherpa.git
cd gh-sherpa
gh extension remove sherpa && gh extension install .
```

>NOTE: You can also use `make install` to install the extension as a binary in your `$GOPATH/bin` or just run the generated binary after a `make build` execution with `./bin/gh-sherpa`.

## Testing the application

You can run the tests with the following command:

```sh
make test
```

### Writing tests

We use [stretchr/testify suite package](https://github.com/stretchr/testify#suite-package) for testing when needed. You can also write regular tests without using the suite package.

### Mocking interfaces

We use [vektra/mockery](https://github.com/vektra/mockery) for mocking interfaces. You can generate the mocks with the following command:

```sh
make generate-mocks
```

This command will generate the mocks in the `internal/mocks` directory, as configured in the [`.mockery.yaml`](.mockery.yaml) file.

>NOTE: Please, refrain from using the generated `NewMockXXXX` constructors. Instead, instantiate the mocks using `&MockXXXX{}`. This is needed because the generated constructors will always execute `mock.AssertExpectation(t)` on cleanup, which will fail if the test does not expect a call to the mock.

### Coverage report

You can also run the tests with coverage with the following command:

```sh
make coverage
```

It will generate a `coverage.out` file in the `.local` directory. You can see the coverage report running the following command:

```sh
go tool cover -html=.local/coverage.out
```

It will generate an HTML file with the coverage report that you can open in your browser.

>NOTE: For Windows WSL users, you may need to convert the `coverage.out` file to a Windows-compatible path. You can do it with the following command:
> ```sh
> wslpath -w PATH/TO/GENERATED/HTML/FILE
> ```

## Verifying code integrity

You can verify the code integrity with the following command:

```sh
make verify
```

This command will do the following:

- Download the required dependencies (`make tidy`)
- Check the code format using [`gofmt`](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/gofmt) (`make checkfmt`).
  - If the code format is not correct, you can fix it with `make fmt`.
- Run the [`staticcheck`](https://staticcheck.dev/) linter (`make lint`)
- Run [go vet](https://pkg.go.dev/cmd/vet) (`make vet`)
- Build the application (`make build`)
- Run the tests (`make test`)

It's recommended to run this command before pushing your changes to the repository.

>NOTE: Since we are using `go run` to execute the required dependencies while verifying, you don't have to install them in your development environment.
